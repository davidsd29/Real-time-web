The application is a real-time application that works with sockets.
It is a game based on the well-known game pictionary. Where one person draws out a word and the others have to guess it. There is a chat function in the game and based on the chat message, it is determined who knows what is being drawn.

The game can be played by several people at the same time because it takes place in separate rooms.

The host receives the room number at the top left and must share it with a guest player. This way, the player can join the room. What is in room .... stays in room...
